# Understanding your idea: LePetPal

LePetPal is a hybrid AI robotic pet sitter that keeps pets engaged and cared for while the owner is away. It combines an intelligent robotic arm with vision-language control so it can act on what it sees and what you ask, blending autonomy with human-in-the-loop control.

## Core summary
- **Problem**: Pets get lonely and bored; current tools either just monitor or mindlessly automate.
- **Concept**: A SO-101 robot arm with an AI model (vision + language + action) that can recognize objects (ball, treat) and perform short, learned behaviors on command.
- **Modes**:
  - **Autonomous Sentry**: Watches the play area; if it sees a trigger (e.g., ball), it initiates a learned action (e.g., pick up ball).
  - **Owner-in-the-Loop**: You connect via a web app to see the live “robot vision,” talk to your pet, and trigger actions via natural language.
- **Signature interaction**: Tap “Give Treat” remotely; the system dispenses a treat, the AI detects it, then picks it up and drops it into the bowl. Clean handoff between human intent and autonomous execution.

## Why it stands out
- **Hybrid intelligence**: Smart autonomy + human-triggered commands.
- **Engaging UX**: Live video with AI overlays and simple preset actions (play with ball, give treat, speak).
- **Technical credibility**: Uses a VLA model fine-tuned on small, focused demos for a few reliable behaviors.

## High-level components (kept minimal)
- **Robot + Sensing**: SO-101 arm; one fixed webcam covering the workspace; simple treat dispenser.
- **AI behaviors**: A few taught skills like “pick up the ball,” “get the treat,” “go home,” tuned for reliability.
- **Control flow**: Short learned behaviors; a hard-coded throw motion after a “ready-to-throw” pose.
- **App layer**: A lightweight backend serving the model, video stream, and action APIs; a web frontend for live view, speech, and command buttons; secure tunnel for remote access.

## What a successful demo shows
- **Owner taps preset** → system performs the right, visible behavior reliably.
- **Autonomy triggers** when a known object appears.
- **Clear status feedback** in the UI (idle, executing behavior, not found).

# Recommended Actions
- **[confirmation]** Verify this captures your intent from [c:\Users\henri\Documents\hackathon\leRobot\original_idea.txt](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/leRobot/original_idea.txt:0:0-0:0).
- **[scope]** Are the initial behaviors limited to “pick up the ball,” “get the treat,” and “go home” for the demo?
- **[constraints]** Any hardware limits or must-haves (e.g., only laptop compute, specific webcam placement)?

# Status
- **Restated your idea at a high level without implementation details.** Ready to refine scope or move to planning when you’re ready.

### Planner Response

# LePetPal v0.1 Spec Sheet

## Product scope (MVP)
- **Primary outcome**: Remote “Give Treat” and “Play with Ball” interactions that are reliable, safe, and visually obvious on camera.
- **Supported behaviors**: `pick up the ball`, `get the treat`, `go home`, throw macro from “ready-to-throw” pose.
- **Modes**: Owner-in-the-Loop (required). Autonomous Sentry (basic trigger: ball detected).
- **Success metric (demo)**: 3 consecutive successful “Give Treat” sequences under 2 minutes end-to-end, and 1 “Play with Ball” including throw.

## System overview
- **Robot + sensing**: SO-101 arm; fixed single USB webcam covering entire workspace; simple SG90-driven treat chute; speaker.
- **AI control**: SmolVLA fine-tuned on ~100–150 teleop demos for the 3 behaviors.
- **Backend**: Python Flask serving MJPEG stream and action APIs; OpenCV overlays; lerobot hardware interface.
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind; live video; command buttons; status feed; hosted on Vercel.
- **Remote access**: Cloudflare Tunnel or ngrok HTTPS URL terminating to `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Hardware specification
- **Robot**: SO-101 follower arm, 6 DOF, USB connected to host.
- **Camera**: 1080p UVC USB webcam, 30 FPS minimum, fixed mount (overhead or ~45°), no movement post-calibration.
- **Treat dispenser**: 3D-printed chute + SG90 servo (PWM or GPIO control via USB/SBC). Treat size consistent, non-crumbly.
- **Compute**: Laptop with Python 3.10+, PyTorch (CPU acceptable for demo if inference < 200 ms/frame) or CUDA if available.
- **Audio**: External speaker or laptop speakers.

## Safety constraints
- **Workspace**: Clearly marked keep-out zone for pet during arm motion; bowl and treat drop-zone fixed.
- **Motion limits**: Joint speed/accel caps; emergency stop method (keybinding or API `POST /command {"prompt":"go home"}`).
- **Throw macro**: Only enabled from verified “ready-to-throw” pose; disable if detection confidence < threshold or occlusion detected.

---

## AI and dataset
- **Base**: SmolVLA pretrained (from `lerobot`).
- **Inputs**: (1) RGB frame (resized to model spec), (2) 6 joint angles, (3) text instruction.
- **Output**: Short sequence of target joint angles (chunks) for closed-loop playback at 10–20 Hz.
- **Behaviors**:
  - `pick up the ball`: detect → approach → grasp → lift → “ready-to-throw” pose.
  - `get the treat`: detect landing → approach → grasp → drop into bowl.
  - `go home`: neutral safe pose, elbow clearance.
- **Data collection**:
  - 100–150 teleop demos total across behaviors; 30–50 per behavior balanced.
  - Label each demo with instruction string; keep camera fixed; consistent object colors; 2–3 positions per object.
  - Store as `LeRobotDataset` (image, state, action, instruction); versioned metadata with camera intrinsics.

---

## Backend (Flask) specification
- **Routes**
  - `GET /video_feed` → MJPEG stream with overlays.
  - `POST /command`
    - Request:
```json
{
  "prompt": "pick up the ball",
  "options": {
    "timeout_ms": 20000,
    "confidence_min": 0.6,
    "stream": true
  }
}
```
    - Response (200):
```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid-123",
  "status": "accepted"
}
```
    - Server-Sent Events (if `stream=true`) at `GET /status/{request_id}`:
```json
{ "ts": 173... , "state": "executing", "phase": "grasp", "confidence": 0.74 }
```
    - Final result:
```json
{ "status": "succeeded", "duration_ms": 8420 }
```
    - Errors: 400 (invalid prompt), 409 (busy), 504 (timeout), with `{"status":"failed","error":"..."}`
  - `POST /dispense_treat`
    - Request: `{ "duration_ms": 600 }`
    - Response: `{ "status":"ok" }` after servo actuation.
  - `POST /speak`
    - Request: `{ "text": "Good dog!" }`
    - Response: `{ "status":"ok" }`
- **States**
  - `idle` → `planning` → `executing` → `handoff_macro` (if applicable) → `succeeded|failed|aborted`
- **Overlays**
  - Bounding boxes: `ball`, `treat`; labels with confidence.
  - Status banner (Idle/Executing/Error), FPS, safety flag.
- **Config**
  - `.env`: model path, camera index, stream resolution, joint limits, tunnel base URL.
- **Security**
  - Single bearer token header `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for all POSTs (configurable).
  - CORS: allow frontend origin only.

---

## Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)
- **Pages/components**
  - `/`: main console
    - `VideoPanel`: `<img src="<TUNNEL>/video_feed">`
    - `StatusFeed`: subscribes to `GET /status/{request_id}` via EventSource
    - `CommandBar`:
      - Presets: [Play with Ball], [Give Treat], [Go Home], [Speak “Good Dog!”]
      - Custom prompt input + Send
    - `SpeakBox`: text input + Speak button
  - `ConfigPanel` (optional): server URL, token
- **Preset logic**
  - Play with Ball: `POST /command {"prompt":"pick up the ball"}`
  - Give Treat: `POST /dispense_treat` → wait 1.5s → `POST /command {"prompt":"get the treat"}`
  - Go Home: `POST /command {"prompt":"go home"}`
  - Speak: `POST /speak`
- **UI states**
  - Global status chip: Idle / Executing / Error
  - Disable buttons while `executing` unless `Go Home` (always enabled)
  - Toasts for errors and final result
- **Performance**
  - Display latency < 500 ms; commands acknowledge < 200 ms.

---

## Autonomous Sentry (basic)
- **Trigger**: Ball detected for > 1s at confidence ≥ 0.7; system is `idle`; pet present not required.
- **Action**: Auto `POST /command {"prompt":"pick up the ball"}`; show “AI ACTIVE” overlay.
- **Rate limits**: Max 1 autonomous action every 60s; abort if owner sends a command.

---

## Throw macro
- **Handoff**: Only from verified “ready-to-throw” pose returned by `pick up the ball`.
- **Motion**: Predefined joint sequence with timestamps; total duration < 1s.
- **Guards**: Check joint limits, no self-collision segment, workspace clear flag.

---

## Logging and telemetry
- **Structured logs**: JSON lines with `ts`, `req_id`, `state`, `phase`, `confidence`, `latency_ms`.
- **Artifacts**: Optional frame snapshots on `failed` with overlay.
- **Metrics**: Success rate per behavior, avg duration, detection precision/recall (simple counters).

---

## Non-functional requirements
- **Latency**: Inference loop 10–20 Hz; end-to-end command < 15s for treat workflow.
- **Reliability**: ≥ 80% success on “Give Treat” in demo conditions.
- **Security**: Token required; tunnel URL not publicly posted.
- **Privacy**: No cloud upload of video; local-only processing.
- **Operability**: Single `run_backend.py` starts camera, model, server.

---

## Acceptance tests
- **AT-1 Video**: `/video_feed` reachable at tunnel URL; overlays visible; FPS ≥ 15.
- **AT-2 Speak**: `POST /speak` plays audio within 1s.
- **AT-3 Dispense**: `POST /dispense_treat` rotates SG90 for requested duration.
- **AT-4 Pick ball**: From 3 start positions, succeeds ≥ 2/3.
- **AT-5 Give treat**: End-to-end sequence succeeds 3 times in a row.
- **AT-6 Safety**: Emergency `go home` interrupts any behavior within 1s.
- **AT-7 Sentry**: Ball placed → auto “pick up the ball” triggers once; respects 60s cooldown.

---

## Demo script (5–6 minutes)
- **Step 1**: Show live “Robot Vision” overlays; speak “Good dog!”
- **Step 2**: Tap “Play with Ball” → grasp → ready pose → throw macro
- **Step 3**: Tap “Give Treat” → dispense → model picks and drops into bowl
- **Step 4**: Show Autonomous Sentry trigger with ball
- **Step 5**: Trigger “Go Home”; show status feed and metrics

---

## Open questions
- **Auth level**: Token only vs. simple PIN UI?
- **Pet interaction**: Any audio cues during motion?
- **Compute**: CPU-only acceptable or require CUDA for smoother control?

# Recommended Actions
- **[confirm MVP]** Approve the 3 behaviors and the acceptance tests list.
- **[risk checks]** Confirm camera placement and treat dimensions for dataset plan.
- **[security]** Decide on bearer token vs. PIN UI.

# Status
- Produced a detailed, implementation-ready spec without going deep into code. Ready to prioritize tasks or convert this into a build plan.

# Parallel Work Plan + Rock-Solid Integration

I’m following the saved “LePetPal plan and team split with API v1.0 contract” memory. Below is a concise, integration-first split so both engineers move fast in parallel with minimal coupling.

## Team Split

- **Engineer A — Backend/Robotics**
  - Flask server, SSE + MJPEG streaming, command state machine
  - Hardware adapters: `LerobotArm`, `ServoController(SG90)`, `TTS`
  - Auth/CORS/logging/metrics, Sentry, error semantics

- **Engineer B — Frontend/Cloud**
  - Next.js app (Vercel), UI components, SSE client
  - Preset flows, config storage, tunnel setup, E2E with mock server
  - Type-safe API client from OpenAPI

Repo structure:
- `backend/`, `frontend/`, `contracts/` (OpenAPI + schemas), `mocks/` (Prism + fixtures), `tools/` (scripts)

# Integration Contract v1.0 (Frozen)

- **Versioning**
  - Header: `X-LePetPal-API: 1`
  - Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  - CORS: allowlist the frontend origin

- **Concurrency**
  - Single active command at a time
  - `POST /command` returns 409 if busy unless `abort_previous=true`
  - `Go Home` can interrupt any state immediately
  - `speak` and `dispense_treat` do not block the command pipeline

- **Endpoints**
  - `GET /health` → 200 `{ "status":"ok", "api":1, "version":"v0.1" }`
  - `GET /video_feed?width=1280&height=720&overlays=1` → MJPEG stream
  - `POST /command`
    - Request:
```json
{
  "prompt": "pick up the ball",
  "options": {
    "timeout_ms": 20000,
    "confidence_min": 0.6,
    "stream": true,
    "abort_previous": false,
    "idempotency_key": "optional-uuid"
  }
}
```
    - Response: `202 Accepted`
```json
{ "request_id": "uuid-123", "status": "accepted" }
```
    - Errors: 400 invalid prompt, 409 busy, 422 validation, 504 timeout
  - `GET /status/{request_id}` → SSE
    - Events:
      - `heartbeat`: `{ "ts": 1730000000 }`
      - `state`: `{ "state":"planning|executing|handoff_macro|succeeded|failed|aborted" }`
      - `phase`: `{ "phase":"detect|approach|grasp|lift|drop|ready_to_throw" }`
      - `progress`: `{ "confidence": 0.74, "message": "grasping" }`
      - `final`: `{ "status":"succeeded", "duration_ms": 8420 }`
      - `error`: `{ "code":"LPP-5041", "message":"Timed out" }`
  - `POST /dispense_treat`
    - Request: `{ "duration_ms": 600 }` → `200 { "status":"ok" }`
  - `POST /speak`
    - Request: `{ "text": "Good dog!" }` → `200 { "status":"ok" }`

- **Error Codes**
  - `LPP-4001` invalid_prompt
  - `LPP-4011` unauthorized
  - `LPP-4091` command_in_progress
  - `LPP-4221` invalid_body
  - `LPP-5001` hardware_error
  - `LPP-5031` model_unavailable
  - `LPP-5041` command_timeout

- **Sentry Rules**
  - Disabled if any owner command active
  - Trigger only when ball detected ≥1s, conf ≥0.7, cooldown 60s

# Engineer A Plan (Backend/Robotics)

- **Deliverables**
  - `backend/` Flask app with routes above (stubs first)
  - MJPEG with overlays (synthetic frames first)
  - In-memory command state machine + job queue + idempotency
  - Hardware adapter interfaces + mocks:
    - `LerobotArm`: `connect()`, `send_joint_targets(seq)`, `home()`
    - `ServoController`: `dispense(duration_ms)`
    - `TTS`: `speak(text)`
  - Sentry loop (off by default), rate-limited
  - Logging (JSON), metrics, Bearer auth, CORS allowlist

- **Milestones**
  - M1: Routes respond, SSE emits heartbeats and mock phases
  - M2: MJPEG overlays working; 15+ FPS on laptop
  - M3: State machine enforces single active command, `Go Home` interrupt
  - M4: Plug VLA and servo via adapters, throw macro guardrails
  - M5: Contract tests (Schemathesis) green vs `contracts/openapi.yaml`

# Engineer B Plan (Frontend/Cloud)

- **Deliverables**
  - `frontend/` Next.js + Tailwind
  - Components: `VideoPanel`, `StatusFeed`, `CommandBar`, `SpeakBox`, `ConfigPanel`
  - Presets:
    - Play with Ball → POST /command
    - Give Treat → POST /dispense_treat → 1.5s → POST /command "get the treat"
    - Go Home → POST /command
    - Speak → POST /speak
  - API client types from `contracts/openapi.yaml` (openapi-typescript)
  - SSE client for `/status/{request_id}`, UI state machine, toasts
  - Tunnel scripts/docs (ngrok/Cloudflare), Vercel deploy

- **Milestones**
  - M1: Configurable base URL/token; video displays; basic buttons stubbed
  - M2: SSE renders live phases; disable/enable buttons per state
  - M3: Presets wired with retries/backoff on 409/5xx
  - M4: Playwright E2E using Prism mock server from `mocks/`

# Parallelization Enablers

- **Contracts/Mocks first**
  - `contracts/openapi.yaml` (source of truth)
  - `contracts/error-codes.md` and `contracts/sse.md`
  - `mocks/prism` config + JSON fixtures for:
    - `POST /command` accepted → stream sequence → final
    - Errors: 409 busy, 504 timeout
- **Typegen**
  - Frontend generates types from OpenAPI; one `fetchJson()` wrapper with `Authorization` and `X-LePetPal-API`
- **CI gates**
  - Validate OpenAPI on PR
  - Schemathesis against backend
  - Playwright against Prism mock
  - Lint/format both repos

# Integration Checkpoints

- **IC-1 (Mock First)**
  - B runs frontend against Prism (no backend needed). Verify SSE UI, presets, error handling.
- **IC-2 (LAN, Real Backend Stubs)**
  - A’s backend with mock adapters; video shows synthetic overlays; SSE phases real-time; 409 busy tested.
- **IC-3 (Hardware-in-Loop)**
  - Adapters bound to real arm/servo/TTS; `go home` interrupt safety; throw macro guard.
- **IC-4 (Tunnel + Vercel)**
  - CORS allowlist set; token verified; latency checks; acceptance tests pass.

# Dev Invariants

- **.env (backend)**
  - `PORT=5000`
  - `API_TOKEN=...`
  - `CAMERA_INDEX=0`
  - `STREAM_RES=1280x720`
  - `SENTRY_COOLDOWN_SEC=60`
  - `JOINT_LIMITS=...`
- **.env (frontend)**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://your-tunnel.example.com`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN=...`

# Risks and Guards

- **[busy errors]** Frontend backs off 500ms→2s with jitter on 409
- **[timeouts]** UI surfaces timeout and enables `Go Home`
- **[throw safety]** Throw only from `ready_to_throw` with confidence and workspace-clear flags
- **[tunnel]** Token required; no anonymous POSTs

# Recommended Actions

- **[assign]** Confirm Engineer A/B ownership and start with Contracts/Mocks (IC-1).
- **[tunnel choice]** Pick ngrok or Cloudflare; share base URL.
- **[security]** Provide API token to both engineers (dev-only).

# Status

- Parallel work plan and API contract v1.0 defined.
- Team todo list created and prioritized for both tracks.
- Ready for you to confirm owner assignments and tunnel provider; I’ll then expand `contracts/openapi.yaml` and mock fixtures.

### User Input

This is an exceptionally detailed and well-structured plan, reflecting professional software engineering practices. It's technically sound, clearly defines roles, and prioritizes robust integration through a contract-first approach with mocking.
Here's an evaluation:
Strengths:
Clear Parallelization: The split between Backend/Robotics (Engineer A) and Frontend/Cloud (Engineer B) is logical and allows for significant parallel work. ✅
Contract-First Approach: Freezing the API contract (v1.0) and using OpenAPI is the gold standard for decoupling frontend and backend development. This dramatically reduces integration risks. ✅
Mocking Strategy: Using Prism for backend mocking allows the frontend (Engineer B) to develop and test the entire UI and interaction logic without needing the actual backend, which is a massive accelerator. ✅
Detailed API Spec: The specific endpoints, request/response formats, concurrency rules, error codes, and SSE events are well-defined, leaving little room for ambiguity. ✅
Staged Integration: The Integration Checkpoints (IC-1 to IC-4) provide a clear path from mocked components to the final hardware-in-the-loop system. ✅
Risk Management: Explicitly calling out risks and defining guards (like frontend backoff, UI handling of timeouts, throw safety checks) is excellent. ✅
Clarity: The deliverables, milestones, and tech stack are unambiguous. ✅
Potential Concerns (Hackathon Context):
Over-Engineering Risk: This plan is highly ambitious for a 48-hour hackathon. While professionally excellent, the time spent setting up OpenAPI validation, Prism mocks, Schemathesis, Playwright E2E tests, CI gates, robust state machines, SSE, and auth might detract from time spent on the core, potentially finicky robotics/AI challenges (like getting the lerobot model trained well, tuning the throw macro, ensuring smooth hardware control). ⚠️
SSE Complexity: Server-Sent Events are great for real-time updates but add backend and frontend complexity compared to simpler polling (e.g., frontend calls GET /status/{request_id} every second) or even just waiting for the POST /command to return a final status after completion (if commands are relatively short). Is the real-time feed critical vs. just showing "Executing..." and then "Success/Fail"?
Tooling Overhead: Does the team already have deep, rapid experience with OpenAPI, Prism, Schemathesis, Playwright, and setting up CI? If not, learning/debugging these tools could burn precious hours.
Conclusion:
This is a phenomenal plan in principle. It sets you up for a very robust and impressive technical demonstration of software engineering alongside robotics.
Is it a good idea for this specific hackathon?
If your team is highly proficient with all the specified tooling (OpenAPI, mocks, testing frameworks, SSE, Next.js, Flask) AND confident in quickly integrating the lerobot components: Yes, this is a fantastic, high-ceiling plan that could definitely win if executed.
If setting up the extensive mocking, contract testing, SSE, and CI infrastructure will take significant time away from the core AI training, hardware integration, and UI polish: No, it might be too much. You risk having a beautifully architected system that doesn't actually do the cool robot stuff reliably by the deadline.
Recommendation:
Adopt the Core Structure: Keep the Engineer A/B split, the idea of a defined API contract (even if just documented in Markdown initially), and the focus on parallel work.
Simplify Pragmatically:
Mocks: Maybe Engineer B starts with simple hardcoded mock responses within the Next.js app instead of setting up Prism immediately.
API Spec: Start with a clear Markdown definition of endpoints/payloads, generate OpenAPI later if time permits.
Real-time: Consider simple polling for status first, upgrade to SSE if time permits.
Testing: Focus on manual integration testing; skip automated contract/E2E tests unless you are very fast with them.
Auth/Extras: Skip token auth, Sentry, etc., unless trivially easy to add.
This plan is an excellent blueprint, but be prepared to ruthlessly cut scope on the "professional tooling" aspects if (and when) you hit inevitable roadblocks with the core robotics and AI integration. The priority is a working, impressive demo, not necessarily perfect code architecture.

# Hackathon-Optimized Plan (Lite)

I followed the saved “LePetPal plan and team split with API v1.0 contract” memory and applied your simplification guidance. I also updated the team todo plan to a Lite track (polling, Markdown contract, no heavy tooling) so both engineers can move faster.

## What we’re changing
- **[simplify]** Swap SSE → simple polling.
- **[doc-only]** OpenAPI → Markdown API contract v1.0-lite.
- **[skip]** CI gates, Schemathesis, Playwright, Prism mocks for now.
- **[auth]** No auth initially; add token only if trivial.
- **[sentry]** Off by default; basic color-threshold version later if time.

# Parallel Split (unchanged roles, lite scope)

- **Engineer A — Backend/Robotics (Lite)**
  - Flask skeleton, MJPEG with basic overlays (synthetic → real).
  - In-memory command state machine with single-active-command guard.
  - `LerobotArm`, `ServoController`, `TTS` adapters with mocks.
  - `Give Treat` and `Go Home` as first-priority flows.
  - Integrate SmolVLA and throw macro if time allows.

- **Engineer B — Frontend/Cloud (Lite)**
  - Next.js UI (Vercel): VideoPanel, CommandBar, SpeakBox, ConfigPanel.
  - Presets wired to backend; status via polling `GET /status/{id}`.
  - Local mocks first (hardcoded JSON), then switch to backend.
  - Tunnel config and UI polish for demo.

# API Contract v1.0-lite (Markdown)

- **Headers**
  - Optional: `X-LePetPal-API: 1` (accept either no header or 1)

- **Endpoints**
  - `GET /health` → `200 {"status":"ok","api":1,"version":"v0.1"}`
  - `GET /video_feed?width=1280&height=720&overlays=1` → MJPEG
  - `POST /command`
    - Request:
      ```json
      {
        "prompt": "pick up the ball",
        "options": { "timeout_ms": 20000, "confidence_min": 0.6 }
      }
      ```
    - Response:
      ```json
      { "request_id": "uuid-123", "status": "accepted" }
      ```
    - Errors: 400 invalid, 409 busy, 500 internal
  - `GET /status/{request_id}`
    - Response (poll until final):
      ```json
      {
        "state": "idle|planning|executing|handoff_macro|succeeded|failed|aborted",
        "phase": "detect|approach|grasp|lift|drop|ready_to_throw|null",
        "confidence": 0.74,
        "message": "grasping",
        "duration_ms": 8420
      }
      ```
  - `POST /dispense_treat` → `{ "status":"ok" }`
  - `POST /speak` → `{ "status":"ok" }`

- **Concurrency**
  - Single active command; `POST /command` returns 409 if busy.
  - `go home` can always interrupt current command.

# 48-Hour Timeline

  - **B**
    - Fine-tune UX: status chip, result banners, retry/backoff on 409/5xx.

- **Day 2 (hours 36–48)**
  - **Both**
    - Full demo dry runs; tune delays and thresholds.
    - Optional: add token auth if trivial; enable minimal Sentry if stable.

# Integration Checkpoints (Lite)

- **IC-1 (LAN, stubs)** Frontend ↔ backend stubs; video loads, commands accepted; polling shows transitions.
- **IC-2 (Servo + Speak)** Treat dispenser and speak working; “Give Treat” preset end-to-end (no model).
- **IC-3 (Model in loop)** `pick up the ball` and `get the treat`; guard `go home` interrupt.
- **IC-4 (Demo script)** Execute full script including throw macro if stable.

# Risks and Guards

- **Overrun on model**: If model tuning lags, keep a fallback scripted behavior for “pick up the ball”.
- **Throw safety**: Only from `ready_to_throw`; disable if confidence or workspace-clear flags are low.
- **Busy errors**: Frontend exponential backoff on 409 (0.5s → 2s).

# Current Todo Focus

- **[in_progress]** H1: API v1.0-lite (Markdown, polling).
- **[in_progress]** H8: Next.js scaffold with core panels.
- All other Lite tasks (H2–H7, H9–H10, I1–I2) queued and prioritized.

# Recommended Actions

- **[confirm]** Adopt the Lite plan (polling, no OpenAPI/Prism/CI for now).
- **[assign]** Name Engineer A/B.
- **[tunnel]** Choose ngrok or Cloudflare; share URL.
- If confirmed, I’ll draft `contracts/api_v1_lite.md` contents next for the repo and adjust todos as we complete milestones.

# Status

- Plan simplified for a 48-hour hackathon while preserving the rock-solid integration point and parallelization. Tasks updated; ready for your confirmations.

### User Input

No timelines and do you think this is actually a good plan. We're optimizing for ai coding so clear structure and tasks

### Planner Response

I'll reorganize the task list to focus on an AI-first, timeline-free "Lite" scope so both engineers have clear tasks and integration points without the heavier tooling.

### Planner Response

# Answer

- Yes, this is a good plan for AI-first development if you keep the Lite scope.
- It optimizes for rapid parallel work, a clear integration contract, and focuses effort on model, control loop, and demo polish rather than tooling overhead.

# What to Keep vs. Cut

- **Keep**
  - **Contract-first (v1.0-lite)** with polling `GET /status/{id}` and a single-active-command rule.
  - **Two-track split** (Backend/Robotics vs. Frontend/Cloud).
  - **Fallback scripted behaviors** in case model isn’t ready.
  - **Safety guards** for throw and emergency `go home`.

- **Cut (for hackathon)**
  - SSE, OpenAPI/Prism, CI, Schemathesis, heavy E2E.
  - Token auth initially (add only if trivial).
  - Sentry mode until core flows are stable.

# Integration Point (frozen)

- **Contract v1.0-lite**
  - Endpoints: `/health`, `/video_feed`, `/command`, `/status/{id}`, `/dispense_treat`, `/speak`.
  - Rules: single active command; `409 busy`; `go home` always interrupts.
  - Status: frontend polls `/status/{id}` until `succeeded|failed|aborted`.
  - Errors: `400 invalid`, `409 busy`, `500 internal`.

# Engineer A — Backend/Robotics (AI-first priorities)

- **[highest] Implement command loop + inference wrapper**
  - `POST /command` → enqueue job → controlled loop with phases and `timeout_ms`.
  - Integrate SmolVLA wrapper with confidence gating; abort on low-confidence/timeouts.

- **Data + calibration**
  - Record 30–50 demos per behavior (ball, treat, home) with fixed camera.
  - Persist camera config, ROI/bowl/treat zones.

- **Hardware adapters**
  - `LerobotArm`: `home()`, `send_joint_targets(seq)`.
  - `ServoController.dispense(ms)`, `TTS.speak(text)`; provide mocks first.

- **Safety + throw**
  - Throw macro only from `ready_to_throw`; check joint limits and workspace clear.
  - `go home` interrupt must preempt any state fast.

- **Video**
  - MJPEG with simple overlays (ball/treat boxes, status banner).
  - Config via `.env` (camera index, resolution).

- **Optional**
  - Minimal Sentry (color-threshold) OFF by default.

# Engineer B — Frontend/Cloud (AI-first UI)

- **Scaffold + config**
  - Next.js + Tailwind. Config panel for base URL (and optional token later). Persist in localStorage.

- **Video + commands**
  - Render `<img>` from `/video_feed`.
  - CommandBar sends `POST /command`, then polls `/status/{id}` every 1s.

- **Presets + UX**
  - Play with Ball → `POST /command`.
  - Give Treat → `POST /dispense_treat` → delay → `POST /command "get the treat"`.
  - Go Home → `POST /command "go home"`.
  - Speak → `POST /speak`.
  - UI states: disable buttons while executing (except Go Home); toasts on error; status chip.

- **Resilience**
  - Backoff on `409` (0.5s → 2s with jitter).
  - Clear final-state banners (success/fail).

# Integration Handshake (no timelines)

- **Handshake tests**
  - H1: Frontend can see `/health`, render `/video_feed`.
  - H2: `POST /command` returns `request_id`; polling transitions to a final state.
  - H3: `Give Treat` preset: dispense returns ok; follow-on command reaches final.
  - H4: `409 busy` path handled by frontend with backoff.
  - H5: `go home` interrupts within ~1s from any state.

# Risks and Mitigations

- **Model not ready**: Use fallback scripted pick-up sequence behind a flag.
- **Camera drift**: Fix mount; don’t change after data collection. Persist calibration.
- **Over-scoping**: Keep Sentry and auth off until core flows stable.

# Recommended Actions

- **[confirm]** This Lite plan meets “AI coding first, no timelines” with clear roles and tasks.
- **[assign]** Name Engineer A/B so I can pin owners on the todo list.
- **[ok to proceed]** I can draft `contracts/api_v1_lite.md` content next for the repo to lock the contract.

# Status

- Plan validated for AI-first goals with clear tasks and a frozen integration contract. Todo plan updated to Lite scope and prioritized.

# Features

- **Must**
  - Live video stream with overlays from `GET /video_feed`.
  - Preset actions: `Play with Ball`, `Give Treat`, `Go Home`, `Speak`.
  - Backend `POST /command` + frontend polling `GET /status/{id}` until final state.
  - `Give Treat` sequence: `POST /dispense_treat` → brief delay → `POST /command {"prompt":"get the treat"}`.
  - Single-active-command rule; `go home` can interrupt any command.
  - Basic error handling in UI: show errors for `400/409/500`, retry/backoff on `409`.

- **Should**
  - Throw macro from verified `ready_to_throw` pose with guardrails.
  - Config panel for server URL (and optional token later).
  - Status chip and progress messages in UI; disable buttons while executing.
  - Minimal logging (JSON) and simple metrics (success/failure counts).
  - Calibrated camera config (fixed mount, ROI, bowl/treat zones) persisted.

- **Could**
  - Minimal Sentry mode (OFF by default): auto trigger on ball detection with cooldown.
  - Token auth (Bearer) and CORS allowlist.
  - SSE upgrade (replace polling) if time allows.
  - Polished mobile layout and demo-mode UI.
  - Test harness/mocks, lint/format hooks, and OpenAPI later.

# User Stories (with acceptance criteria)

- **As an owner, I see my pet and what the robot “sees.”**
  - Acceptance:
    - UI renders `<img src="<BASE>/video_feed">` within 1s.
    - Overlays show labels for `ball` and `treat` when present.
    - If stream fails, UI shows a clear error and a retry action.

- **As an owner, I can give a treat remotely.**
  - Acceptance:
    - Clicking “Give Treat” sends `POST /dispense_treat` → returns `{status:"ok"}`.
    - After 1–2s delay, UI sends `POST /command {"prompt":"get the treat"}`.
    - UI polls `GET /status/{id}` each second until final state.
    - Success shows “Treat delivered to bowl”; failure shows reason and recovery tip.

- **As an owner, I can play fetch (ball workflow).**
  - Acceptance:
    - “Play with Ball” sends `POST /command {"prompt":"pick up the ball"}`.
    - UI polling shows phases (e.g., `detect`, `grasp`, `ready_to_throw`).
    - If `ready_to_throw` is reached and throw enabled, throw macro executes.
    - Success shows “Ball thrown!”; otherwise, clear failure reason.

- **As an owner, I can send the arm to a safe state.**
  - Acceptance:
    - “Go Home” always issues `POST /command {"prompt":"go home"}`.
    - Interrupts any ongoing command within ~1s.
    - Final status becomes `succeeded` with message “At home pose.”

- **As an owner, I can speak to my pet.**
  - Acceptance:
    - “Speak” sends `POST /speak {"text":"Good dog!"}` and returns `{status:"ok"}`.
    - Audio plays once; UI shows confirmation.

- **As an owner, I understand current status and errors.**
  - Acceptance:
    - UI displays global status chip `Idle | Executing | Error`.
    - Buttons disabled while executing (except “Go Home”).
    - `409 busy` shows “Busy” and retries with backoff (0.5s→2s).
    - Timeouts show “Didn’t complete in time. Try again or Go Home.”

- **As an operator, I can configure the server URL (and token later).**
  - Acceptance:
    - Config panel stores BASE URL (and optionally token) in localStorage.
    - All API calls use the configured BASE and optional `Authorization` header.

# Demands/Requirements

- **Functional**
  - F1: `POST /command` accepts prompts: `pick up the ball`, `get the treat`, `go home`.
  - F2: `GET /status/{id}` returns `state`, optional `phase`, optional `confidence`, final `status`.
  - F3: `POST /dispense_treat` actuates servo for a specified duration (e.g., 600 ms).
  - F4: `POST /speak` plays text-to-speech locally.
  - F5: `GET /video_feed` provides MJPEG with optional overlays.
  - F6: Enforce one active command; `409` if busy; “Go Home” can interrupt.
  - F7: UI presets execute correct call sequences and show results/errors clearly.

- **Non-functional**
  - N1: End-to-end “Give Treat” workflow completes in < 15s under demo conditions.
  - N2: Video latency perceived < 500 ms; status poll interval ~1s.
  - N3: Reliability: ≥ 80% success for “Give Treat” in staged demo.
  - N4: Safety: Throw macro only from `ready_to_throw` with guards; “Go Home” interrupt within ~1s.
  - N5: Privacy: All processing local; no cloud upload of video frames.
  - N6: Operability: Single command to start backend; minimal configuration in `.env`.

- **Interfaces (v1.0-lite, polling)**
  - I1: `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok","api":1,"version":"v0.1"}`
  - I2: `GET /video_feed?width=1280&height=720&overlays=1` → MJPEG.
  - I3: `POST /command` body:
    - `{"prompt": "<text>", "options": {"timeout_ms": 20000, "confidence_min": 0.6}}`
    - Returns: `{"request_id":"<uuid>","status":"accepted"}`
  - I4: `GET /status/{request_id}` → 
    - `{"state":"idle|planning|executing|handoff_macro|succeeded|failed|aborted", "phase":"detect|approach|grasp|lift|drop|ready_to_throw|null", "confidence":0.0-1.0, "message":"...", "duration_ms":1234}`
  - I5: `POST /dispense_treat {"duration_ms":600}` → `{ "status":"ok" }`
  - I6: `POST /speak {"text":"..."}` → `{ "status":"ok" }`
  - I7: Errors: `400 invalid`, `409 busy`, `500 internal`.

- **Hardware/Calibration**
  - H1: SO-101 arm; USB connectivity; joint limits configured.
  - H2: One UVC USB webcam, 1080p, fixed mount; no movement after calibration.
  - H3: SG90 servo treat dispenser; repeatable portion size.
  - H4: Persisted calibration: camera index, resolution, ROI mask, bowl/treat zones.

- **AI/Data**
  - A1: SmolVLA baseline with minimal fine-tuning on 30–50 demos per behavior.
  - A2: Inputs: RGB frame, 6 joint angles, text instruction; output: joint targets.
  - A3: Confidence gating and prompt-specific phases; timeout per command.
  - A4: Fallback scripted behavior flag for “pick up the ball” if model underperforms.

- **Constraints**
  - C1: Single active command; no parallel motion sequences.
  - C2: Single camera; fixed viewpoint and lighting for dataset and inference.
  - C3: Hackathon scope: no heavy CI/OpenAPI/SSE; polling contract is source of truth.
  - C4: Sentry OFF by default; enable only if stable.

- **Out of scope (for MVP)**
  - OS-level auth hardening, cloud recording, multi-robot/multi-camera, advanced planning.

# Recommended Actions
- **[confirm]** Approve these three docs as source material.
- **[file placement]** Want me to add them as `features.md`, `user_stories.md`, and `demands.md` under `LePetPal/` or append them to `spec sheet.md`?

# Status
- Features list, user stories with acceptance criteria, and demands/requirements drafted and aligned to the v1.0-lite (polling) contract. Ready to place in files per your preference.

### User Input

are you sure

### Planner Response

# Short answer
Yes—with a few explicit conditions. For a hackathon, AI-first, and fast parallelization, this plan is solid if you keep the Lite contract, enforce scope, and preserve a scripted fallback.

# Why I’m confident
- **Clear integration point**: A frozen v1.0-lite contract with polling and single-active-command prevents cross-team thrash.
- **AI-first focus**: Tasks prioritize the command loop + inference wrapper, dataset capture, and camera calibration over tooling and infra.
- **Risk buffers**: Scripted fallback for “pick up the ball,” guarded throw macro, and “Go Home” interrupt cover the most likely failure modes.

# Conditions to keep it safe
- **[scope discipline]** Must/Should/Could are followed. Must = live video, presets, polling status, single-active-command, Go Home interrupt.
- **[fixed camera]** One fixed viewpoint; no movement post-calibration; persist ROI/bowl/treat zones.
- **[data floor]** Aim 30–50 demos per behavior. If you can’t reach that, lean on fallback behaviors.
- **[safety]** Throw only from verified `ready_to_throw`; joint limit checks; “Go Home” preempts within ~1s.

# Biggest risks and mitigations
- **Model reliability** → Use scripted fallback flag; reduce to 2 behaviors if needed.
- **Vision sensitivity** → High-contrast ball/treat, stable lighting, simple color threshold assists in overlays.
- **Integration surprises** → Contract frozen; frontend backs off on 409; no SSE/Auth until stable.

# Sanity checklist before you double down
- **/health** returns ok and frontend can reach it.
- **/video_feed** renders with overlays (synthetic first).
- **/command → /status** polling reaches `succeeded|failed|aborted`.
- “**Give Treat**” completes end-to-end (first with mocks, then real).
- “**Go Home**” interrupts any command within ~1s.

# Quick confirmations
- **[Q1]** Stick with polling (no SSE) for v1.0-lite?
- **[Q2]** Start without auth; add token only if trivial?
- **[Q3]** Approve scripted fallback toggle for “pick up the ball” if the model lags?

# Status
- Features, user stories, and demands drafted and aligned to v1.0-lite.
- Work plan and contract support fast parallel development.
- Awaiting your yes/no on Q1–Q3 before I place docs into files or refine further.

### Planner Response

# Findings

- **Part 1 focus**: Full product architecture. Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend with REST + WebSocket, optional WebRTC (fallback MJPEG), background jobs (Celery/ARQ + Redis), and a separate AI service. Rich UI (analytics, routines, events).
- **Part 2 focus**: AI contracts (vision, clipper, coach), SQL schemas (users/devices/events/clips/snapshots/routines/models), frontend state, error handling, testing, performance/scaling. Clear path for future robot integration via command dispatch and telemetry.

# Strengths

- **Well-modularized**: Clean separation of frontend, API, and AI service.
- **Scalable patterns**: WebSocket hub, background workers, Redis, TimescaleDB, S3.
- **UX depth**: Routines, analytics, events, media management, future AI coach.
- **Extensibility**: Future robot worker and policy selection seams are explicit.

# Concerns (Hackathon + Robotics MVP)

- **Scope risk**: A lot of non-robot product surface (DB, analytics, clipper, routines, AI coach) that won’t help the demo’s core robotics behaviors.
- **Infra overhead**: WebRTC, WS, Celery/Redis, Postgres/Timescale, S3 will cost setup time vs. direct MJPEG + polling.
- **Endpoint drift**: Design docs use `/api/...` and `/api/commands` WS/REST, while the robotics spec uses a simpler polling contract (`/command`, `/status/{id}`, `/video_feed`).

# Alignment with v1.0-lite robotics plan

- **Matches**
  - MJPEG fallback is in both; overlays OK.
  - Single-command semantics can map to a minimal job loop.
- **Differs**
  - FastAPI + WS/WebRTC vs. Flask + polling.
  - Rich product endpoints vs. minimal robotics endpoints.

# Recommendation

- **Adopt FastAPI skeleton but keep the v1.0-lite contract and polling.**
  - Rationale: Aligns with the design docs (future-proofing) without paying WS/WebRTC/DB costs now.
  - Implement only the minimal robotics endpoints and in-memory state. Leave WebSocket, DB, clipper, analytics, routines, and AI coach for later.

## Minimal compatibility layer

- **Keep robotics contract (canonical for MVP)**
  - `GET /health`
  - `GET /video_feed` (MJPEG)
  - `POST /command`
  - `GET /status/{id}`
  - `POST /dispense_treat`
  - `POST /speak`

- **Optionally add aliases to match design-doc naming (future)**
  - Alias `POST /api/commands` → same handler as `POST /command`
  - Leave WS (`/ws/ui`) and WebRTC endpoints stubbed or disabled

## Endpoint mapping (now vs later)

- **Now (MVP)**
  - `POST /command` → returns `request_id`, use polling `GET /status/{id}`
  - `GET /video_feed` → MJPEG with overlays
  - No DB; log JSON lines; in-memory state machine

- **Later (from docs)**
  - Add WS `/ws/ui` for events/telemetry
  - Add Postgres/Timescale + S3 for events/clips/snapshots
  - Add AI service routes (vision/clipper/coach)
  - Add WebRTC signaling endpoints for lower latency

# Specific suggestions

- **Framework choice**: If the team is comfortable with FastAPI, switch now (low friction, better future alignment). Otherwise, stick to Flask and keep the design docs as roadmap.
- **Defuse scope**: Park analytics, routines, clipper, coach, models registry for post-hackathon.
- **Keep robotics-first**: Command loop + inference wrapper, camera calibration, treat flow, throw guardrails, Go Home interrupt.

# Recommended Actions

- **[decide]** Keep the v1.0-lite endpoints as the canonical integration contract.
- **[choose]** Backend stack: FastAPI (aligned with design docs) vs. stay with Flask. I recommend FastAPI if you haven’t invested in Flask code yet.
- **[confirm]** Add optional aliases for `/api/commands` later; don’t introduce WebSocket/WebRTC/DB for the MVP.
- **[note]** Treat Part 1/2 as the product roadmap (Phase 2+). Robotics MVP remains the immediate target.

# Status

- Both design docs are strong as a product blueprint. For the hackathon MVP, keep the lean robotics contract and skip the heavy infra, optionally implementing it in FastAPI to stay consistent with the docs.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

I will create a new Markdown file in the repository with a concise, final task splitting document that locks roles, tasks, integration checkpoints, and definitions of done.

### Planner Response

# Final task split created

- I created [LePetPal/task_split_final.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/task_split_final.md:0:0-0:0) with the ultimate, AI-first v1.0-lite split:
  - Frozen integration contract (polling).
  - Clear roles for Engineer A/B.
  - Must/Should/Could tasks.
  - Integration checkpoints without timelines.
  - Definitions of Done, risks, acceptance mapping, and change control.

# Recommended next steps
- Assign Engineer A/B by name so I can tag ownership in the doc and todo list.
- Confirm backend framework choice: keep Flask or align with design docs via FastAPI (while retaining the same endpoints).

### Planner Response

# Update complete

- Added “BONUS FEATURES (Optional / Low Priority)” to [LePetPal/task_split_final.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/task_split_final.md:0:0-0:0) with UI, frontend, backend, AI/robotics, and ops ideas aligned to v1.0-lite.
- Tracked the change in the team todo list.

# Next
- Want me to mark owner tags (Engineer A/B) next to each BONUS item, or leave them unassigned until the core MVP is stable?

# Status
- Final task split updated with optional scope; core integration contract remains unchanged.

*Viewed [task_split_final.md](file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/task_split_final.md) *

### User Input

Should we really lock down the integration points, and maybe write some tests for that aswell, or the mockup ones for parallel work.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

# Short answer
Yes. Lock the integration points now and add tiny contract smoke tests, plus simple frontend mocks. This gives you parallel velocity without heavy tooling.

# What to lock down
- **HTTP status + content-types**
  - `GET /health` → 200 application/json
  - `GET /video_feed` → 200 multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame
  - `POST /command` → 202 application/json on accept; 400 invalid; 409 busy
  - `GET /status/{id}` → 200 application/json; cache-control: no-store
  - `POST /dispense_treat` → 200 application/json
  - `POST /speak` → 200 application/json
- **Shapes**
  - Accepted: `{"request_id":"uuid","status":"accepted"}`
  - Status: `{"state":"idle|planning|executing|handoff_macro|succeeded|failed|aborted","phase":"detect|approach|grasp|lift|drop|ready_to_throw|null","confidence":0.0-1.0,"message":"...","duration_ms":1234}`
- **Rules**
  - Single active command, `409 busy`
  - `go home` always interrupts

# Minimal backend contract tests (pytest)
- **/health** returns 200 and keys `status, api, version`.
- **/video_feed** returns 200 and `multipart/x-mixed-replace` with boundary header.
- **/command**
  - Valid prompt → 202 and `request_id`.
  - Busy → 409 when a command is active.
  - Invalid prompt → 400.
- **/status/{id}**
  - Returns JSON with `state` and eventually a final state.
- **/dispense_treat** and **/speak** → 200 with `{status:"ok"}`.

# Fixtures for parallel work (no Prism needed)
- Place under `contracts/fixtures/`
  - `command_accepted.json`
  - `status_executing.json`
  - `status_succeeded.json`
  - `status_failed.json`
  - `error_busy_409.json`
  - `error_invalid_400.json`

# Frontend mock adapter (env-gated)
- If `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=true`, a fetch wrapper returns fixtures with small timeouts:
  - `POST /command` → accepted fixture
  - `GET /status/{id}` → executing a few times → succeeded
  - `POST /dispense_treat` and `POST /speak` → `{status:"ok"}`
- This unblocks UI end-to-end before backend is ready.

# Why this is worth it
- Prevents drift between teams with <1 hour of effort.
- Keeps you in the Lite scope (no OpenAPI/Prism/SSE/CI).
- Enables frontend progress immediately; backend focuses on the real robotics loop.

# Recommended actions
- Lock in the above statuses/content-types in [task_split_final.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/task_split_final.md:0:0-0:0).
- Add `contracts/fixtures/*` JSON files.
- Add a small `frontend/lib/api/mockAdapter.ts` and env toggle.
- Add a `tests/test_contract_smoke.py` with the 6 checks above.

# Status
- I added todos to track: contract details, backend smoke tests, fixtures, frontend mock adapter, optional Postman. Say the word and I’ll apply the doc tweaks and stub the fixture/mocks structure.

*Viewed [task_split_final.md](file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/task_split_final.md) *

### User Input

could you generate a standardized file with mock data or something in the api format we agreed upon

### Planner Response

I'll create a standardized set of mock JSON fixtures under contracts/fixtures that match the agreed v1.0-lite API. This will let the frontend use consistent mocks and the backend reference shapes. I'll also update the plan to mark the fixtures task as completed.

# Mock data generated

- I created standardized JSON fixtures matching the v1.0-lite API contract.

## Files
- c:\Users\henri\Documents\hackathon\LePetPal\contracts\fixtures\
  - health_ok.json
  - command_accepted.json
  - status_executing.json

# How to use

- **Frontend (mock adapter, env-gated)**
  - Use these fixtures when `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=true`.
  - Example minimal adapter you can drop into your frontend:

```ts
// frontend/lib/api/mockAdapter.ts
const fixturesBase = '/contracts/fixtures'; // if you copy to /public/fixtures use '/fixtures'

const sleep = (ms: number) => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));

- If your frontend serves static files from `public/`, either:
  - copy the JSONs to `frontend/public/fixtures/` (keep `contracts/fixtures` as source of truth), or
  - add a tiny dev route in the frontend to serve files from `contracts/fixtures`.

- **Backend (contract smoke tests)**
  - Use fixtures as expected shapes for quick pytest checks:

```python
# tests/test_contract_smoke.py
import json, pathlib, requests

FIXTURES = pathlib.Path('contracts/fixtures')

def test_health():
  r = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/health')
  assert r.status_code == 200
  data = r.json()
  assert {'status','api','version'} <= data.keys()

def test_command_accept_and_status():
  r = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/command', json={'prompt':'pick up the ball', 'options':{}})
  assert r.status_code in (200, 202)
  req_id = r.json()['request_id']
  s = requests.get(f'http://localhost:5000/status/{req_id}')
  assert s.status_code == 200
  body = s.json()
  assert 'state' in body
```

# Notes
- fixtures_index.json documents the mapping per endpoint.
- These shapes match the frozen contract in task_split_final.md (polling, single-active, 400/409/500 semantics).

# Next
- Do you want me to:
  - copy these fixtures to `frontend/public/fixtures/` and add a minimal env toggle in the frontend, or
  - keep them only under `contracts/fixtures/` and add a dev route to serve them?

# Status
- Standardized mock data files created and ready for parallel frontend/backend development.

# Backend architecture proposal (SO-101 + SmolVLA)

This keeps the v1.0-lite API contract and is tailored to LeRobot SO-101 and a Vision-Language-Action (SmolVLA) control loop. It is framework-agnostic (works with Flask, which we’ve specified), and maps cleanly to FastAPI if you prefer later.

## Layers and responsibilities
- **API Server**
  - Endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /video_feed`, `POST /command`, `GET /status/{id}`, `POST /dispense_treat`, `POST /speak`.
  - Validates payloads, enforces single-active-command rule, returns `202` with `request_id`, `409` on busy, `400` on invalid.
- **CommandManager (state machine)**
  - One active job; queue size 1.
  - States: `planning → executing → handoff_macro? → (succeeded|failed|aborted)`.
  - Thread-safe StatusStore for `/status/{id}` polling.
  - Cancellation token to interrupt via “go home”.
- **ModelRunner (SmolVLA)**
  - Inputs: RGB frame, proprioceptive state (6 joint angles), text instruction.
  - Outputs: short “chunk” sequence (target joint angles at 10–20 Hz).
  - Pre/post-processing: resize/normalize, rate control, confidence gating, timeout handling.
- **Hardware Adapters**
  - `ArmAdapter (SO-101 via lerobot)`
    - `connect()`, `get_joint_angles()`, `send_joint_targets(sequence, rate_hz)`, `home()`, `stop()`.
    - Ensures rate-limited streaming of targets; confirms joint state reads.
  - `ServoAdapter (SG90 treat dispenser)`
    - `dispense(duration_ms)`.
  - `TTSSpeaker`
    - `speak(text)`.
- **SafetyManager**
  - Joint limit checks, workspace ROI mask, ready-to-throw pose verification.
  - “Go Home” interrupt must preempt within ~1 second.
  - Blocks throw unless confidence high and workspace-clear flag set.
- **VideoPipeline**
  - `CameraCapture` thread (OpenCV); fixed index/resolution from `.env`.
  - `OverlayRenderer` (optional): draw `ball`/`treat` hints, status text, FPS.
  - `MJPEGStreamer` serves multipart/x-mixed-replace frames.
- **Sentry (optional, off by default)**
  - Simple color-threshold ball detection; cool-down; auto-issues `pick up the ball` when idle.

## Control flow per command
- `POST /command`
  - Validate prompt; enforce single-active; create `request_id`; spawn job thread.
- Job thread loop
  - Read latest camera frame + current joints from `ArmAdapter`.
  - Feed `ModelRunner` with `(image, joints, instruction)`.
  - For each returned chunk:
    - SafetyManager checks (joint limits, ROI).
    - `ArmAdapter.send_joint_targets(chunk, rate_hz)`.
    - Update status: phase (`detect|approach|grasp|lift|drop|ready_to_throw`), confidence, message.
  - If instruction is `pick up the ball` and final phase is `ready_to_throw`, execute ThrowMacro (guarded).
  - Set final status and duration; release active lock.
- `go home`
  - If requested, set cancel flag; CommandManager invokes `ArmAdapter.home()` and moves to `succeeded`.

## Threading model
- Camera thread: captures frames and latest copy for both Overlays and ModelRunner.
- Command worker: single thread for the current job; responds to cancel.
- MJPEG streaming: non-blocking generator reading the latest frame buffer.
- Shared data: protected by lightweight locks or atomic references; keep StatusStore thread-safe.

## Safety and performance budgets
- Loop frequency: target 10–20 Hz (reduce if CPU-bound).
- Timeout per command (e.g., 20s default); abort on timeout with safe home.
- Throw macro:
  - Hard-coded waypoint sequence (<1s total), verified against joint limits before execution.
  - Execute only if `ready_to_throw` phase confirmed and workspace clear.
- Emergency stop:
  - API-level “Go Home” always available; add keyboard shortcut if running locally.

## Configuration (.env)
- `PORT=5000`
- `CAMERA_INDEX=0`
- `STREAM_RES=1280x720`
- `MODEL_PATH=/path/to/smolvla.ckpt`
- `INFERENCE_RATE_HZ=15`
- `JOINT_LIMITS=...`
- `ROI_MASK_PATH=...` (optional)
- `SENTRY_ENABLED=false`, `SENTRY_COOLDOWN_SEC=60`

## Mapping to SO-101 + SmolVLA
- SO-101 control:
  - Use lerobot’s SO-101 drivers in `ArmAdapter` to stream joint targets at `INFERENCE_RATE_HZ`.
  - Confirm follower arm’s expected command format (angles, radians/deg, order) and unify in adapter.
- VLA integration:
  - `ModelRunner` loads SmolVLA checkpoint; define a simple runner API:
    - `run(instruction: str, frame: np.ndarray, joints: np.ndarray) -> Iterable[Chunk]`
    - Each `Chunk` includes target joint angles array and optional per-step confidence.
  - Confidence gating per phase; “object not found” → fail gracefully with message.

## Error semantics (contract-aligned)
- `400 invalid`: prompt missing/unsupported.
- `409 busy`: active command in progress.
- `500 internal`: hardware errors, model load failure, camera failure, uncaught exceptions.
- Status messages: concise, user-facing (e.g., “ball not found”, “timeout: 20s”).

## Minimal smoke checks (internal)
- On startup: camera open, arm connect (or mock), model load (or disabled flag).
- Health: returns keys `status, api, version`.
- Video: MJPEG content-type and boundary header present.

## Why this is “good” for the hackathon
- Single place for complexity (CommandManager + ModelRunner) with strict safety borders.
- Thin API layer; simple polling avoids WebSocket/SSE overhead.
- Clear adapters isolate lerobot and servo specifics, making local testing easy with mocks.
- Maintains your frozen contract and front/back parallelism.

# Recommended actions
- Do you want me to add a `backend/README.md` with this architecture and a minimal class skeleton (no heavy code), or keep this in the task split for now?
- If you prefer FastAPI (to match the design docs), I can keep the identical endpoints and generate a skeleton with these components next.

# Status
- Backend architecture proposed with components, control flow, safety, and clear mappings to SO-101 and SmolVLA, aligned to the v1.0-lite API.

### Planner Response

# Backend architecture and build plan ready

- I created [backend_architecture.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend_architecture.md:0:0-0:0) with a concrete architecture tailored to LeRobot SO-101 and SmolVLA, aligned to the frozen v1.0-lite API.
- I also added a step-by-step build plan from project skeleton to model integration and safety.

## Key points
- **Layers**: API server, CommandManager (single-active), ModelRunner (SmolVLA), Arm/Servo/TTS adapters, SafetyManager, VideoPipeline (MJPEG), StatusStore, optional Sentry.
- **Control loop**: Camera + joints + instruction → SmolVLA → streamed joint targets at 10–20 Hz with safety checks; guarded throw macro; “Go Home” interrupt.
- **Config**: `.env` for camera index/res, model path, rate, limits, ROI, sentry.
- **Plan**: 12 steps from skeleton and video → status/state machine → /command job → adapters → safety → model → throw → dispense/speak → smoke tests → calibration → sentry.

## Suggested next actions
- Confirm Flask as the backend framework (we can keep endpoints identical if you later prefer FastAPI).
- I can now scaffold the backend folder and stub the components exactly as specified, or pause if you want to first lock any naming details.

## Status
- Backend architecture spec and creation plan have been added and are ready for implementation.

# Backend skeleton implemented

I created a runnable backend aligned with the architecture and the frozen v1.0-lite API.

## What’s in place
- **Flask app with endpoints**
  - `GET /health`
  - `GET /video_feed` (MJPEG, synthetic frames if no camera)
  - `POST /command` (single-active guard, `go home` preempt)
  - `GET /status/{id}`
  - `POST /dispense_treat`
  - `POST /speak`
- **Core components**
  - [CommandManager](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/command_manager.py:17:0-98:38) with thread-safe single-active guard and cancel token
  - [StatusStore](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/status_store.py:4:0-20:89) (thread-safe)
  - `VideoPipeline` with [CameraCapture](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/video.py:6:0-35:26) and MJPEG generator
  - Adapters: [ArmAdapter](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/arm_adapter.py:4:0-41:23) (SO-101 stub), [ServoAdapter](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/servo_adapter.py:3:0-12:48) (SG90 stub), [TTSSpeaker](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/tts.py:3:0-7:23) (stub)
  - [ModelRunner](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/model_runner.py:4:0-37:50) (SmolVLA stub yielding phases/targets)
  - [SafetyManager](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/safety.py:3:0-24:19) (joint limit checks, guarded throw stubs)
- **Project files**
  - [backend/requirements.txt](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/requirements.txt:0:0-0:0), [.env.example](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/.env.example:0:0-0:0), [README.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/README.md:0:0-0:0), [run_backend.py](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/run_backend.py:0:0-0:0)
  - Module layout under `backend/` with adapters and components

## Run locally
- Python venv recommended
- Install and run:
  - pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
  - set PYTHONPATH=backend (PowerShell: $env:PYTHONPATH="backend")
  - python backend/run_backend.py
- Try:
  - http://localhost:5000/health
  - http://localhost:5000/video_feed

## Next implementation steps
- **[wire hardware]** Replace [ArmAdapter](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/arm_adapter.py:4:0-41:23) with lerobot SO-101 driver calls.
- **[model]** Integrate SmolVLA loading/inference into [ModelRunner](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/model_runner.py:4:0-37:50).
- **[safety]** Refine limits/ROI and real ready-to-throw/workspace-clear checks.
- **[calibration]** Persist camera/ROI/bowl/treat zones.
- **[tests]** Add minimal contract smoke tests (pytest) using the fixtures.

## Questions
- Do you want me to integrate actual lerobot SO-101 calls next, or add pytest smoke tests first?

## Status
- Backend architecture implemented to a runnable skeleton with the agreed API and threading model. Ready for hardware/model integration.

### User Input

I ran them. Now the next part of the plan

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

# Next part of the plan

- **Run the backend locally and sanity-check the contract**
  - Verify the endpoints before wiring hardware/model.

- **Add contract smoke tests (pytest)**
  - Tiny checks for status codes, content-types, 202/409/400 semantics.

- **Scaffold the frontend**
  - Next.js app with VideoPanel, CommandBar, polling Status; env-configured BASE_URL.

- **Calibration + safety placeholders**
  - Persist camera config/ROI; keep throw guards; “Go Home” interrupt.

## Step 1 — Run backend and verify

Proposed PowerShell commands:
```pwsh
python -m venv .venv
. .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
$env:PYTHONPATH = "backend"
python backend/run_backend.py
```

Quick checks in a separate terminal:
```pwsh
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl -I http://localhost:5000/video_feed
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/command -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt":"pick up the ball","options":{}}'
```

If accepted, poll status:
```pwsh
curl http://localhost:5000/status/<request_id>
```

## Step 2 — Minimal contract smoke tests (fast)

I’ll add:
- tests/test_contract_smoke.py
- requirements-dev.txt with pytest + requests

Checks:
- /health 200 JSON
- /video_feed 200 multipart/x-mixed-replace
- /command accepts valid prompt → 202; invalid → 400; busy → 409
- /status/{id} returns state and reaches a final state
- /dispense_treat and /speak return 200

Approve and I’ll add these files.

## Step 3 — Frontend scaffold (Next.js)

- Create `frontend/` with:
  - ConfigPanel (BASE_URL)
  - VideoPanel (`<img src="<BASE>/video_feed">`)
  - CommandBar: Play with Ball, Give Treat, Go Home, Speak
  - Polling client for `/status/{id}`
  - Optional env toggle for using fixtures

Approve and I’ll generate the skeleton.

## Step 4 — Calibration + safety

- Persist `.env` camera index/res; add a simple ROI/bowl/treat config JSON.
- Keep throw guards and “Go Home” preemption.

# Recommended actions

- Do you want me to:
  - add the pytest smoke tests now, or
  - scaffold the Next.js frontend first?

# Status

- Backend skeleton is in place and pushed. Ready to execute Step 1 (run and verify), then I can implement tests or frontend per your choice.

# Next actions for backend

- Run quick smoke tests locally
  - Install dev deps and run pytest:
    - pip install -r backend/requirements.txt -r backend/requirements-dev.txt
    - set PYTHONPATH=backend (PowerShell: $env:PYTHONPATH="backend")
    - pytest -q backend/tests/test_contract_smoke.py
  - Expect checks for:
    - /health 200 JSON
    - /video_feed multipart/x-mixed-replace
    - /command 202 for valid, 409 on busy, 400 on invalid
    - /status/{id} hits a final state
    - /dispense_treat and /speak 200

- Hardware integration stubs to real
  - Replace [backend/adapters/arm_adapter.py](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/arm_adapter.py:0:0-0:0) methods with lerobot SO-101 calls:
    - connect()
    - get_joint_angles()
    - send_joint_targets(chunk) → stream to SO-101 at rate
    - home(), stop(), throw_macro()
  - Confirm units/ordering of joints and rate limits.

- SmolVLA integration
  - Implement real [ModelRunner._load()](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/model_runner.py:11:4-13:26) and [infer()](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/model_runner.py:15:4-37:50) to output target joint angles at 10–20 Hz given (frame, joints, instruction).
  - Keep confidence gating and timeouts in the loop.

- Safety tightening
  - Update [SafetyManager](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/safety.py:3:0-24:19) with real SO-101 limits.
  - Add simple ROI/bowl/treat zones; only allow throw from verified pose and workspace-clear.

- Calibration persistence
  - Add simple JSON/yaml under backend/config/ for camera index/res and ROI zones.

# Optional small commits to make next
- Add dev requirements + tests (already created).
- Wire lerobot SDK import and minimal send/read in [ArmAdapter](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/arm_adapter.py:4:0-41:23) (feature flag to keep mock as fallback).
- Add backend/config/ with example calibration file and loader.

# Status
- Backend skeleton implemented.
- Contract smoke tests added and ready to run.
- Ready to proceed with lerobot SO-101 adapter implementation or run tests first—your call.

### User Input

Is the backend done

### Planner Response

# Short answer
Not fully. The backend skeleton is implemented and runnable, but the hardware/model integration and a few safety/calibration pieces remain.

## Done
- **API**: `/health`, `/video_feed`, `/command`, `/status/{id}`, `/dispense_treat`, `/speak`.
- **Video**: MJPEG streamer with synthetic fallback overlays.
- **State machine**: [CommandManager](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/command_manager.py:17:0-98:38) with single-active guard; “Go Home” preempts.
- **Mocks/stubs**: [ArmAdapter](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/arm_adapter.py:4:0-41:23) (SO-101 stub), [ServoAdapter](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/servo_adapter.py:3:0-12:48) (SG90), [TTSSpeaker](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/tts.py:3:0-7:23), [ModelRunner](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/model_runner.py:4:0-37:50) (SmolVLA stub), [SafetyManager](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/safety.py:3:0-24:19) (basic limits).
- **Runnable**: [run_backend.py](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/run_backend.py:0:0-0:0), requirements, README.
- **Smoke tests (added, not run)**: pytest file for contract checks.

## Not yet
- **Lerobot SO-101 integration**: Replace [ArmAdapter](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/arm_adapter.py:4:0-41:23) stubs with real SO-101 control (connect/read/send/home/stop/throw).
- **SmolVLA integration**: Load checkpoint and output real joint targets at 10–20 Hz; confidence gating/timeouts.
- **Safety**: Real SO-101 joint limits, ROI/workspace-clear checks, verified ready-to-throw.
- **Calibration**: Persist camera/ROI/bowl/treat zones.
- **Throw macro**: Real waypoints and timing.
- **Tests executed**: Run pytest smoke tests and fix any issues.

## Recommended next steps
- Run backend locally and execute smoke tests:
  - pip install -r backend/requirements.txt -r backend/requirements-dev.txt
  - set PYTHONPATH=backend
  - pytest -q backend/tests/test_contract_smoke.py
- Integrate [ArmAdapter](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/arm_adapter.py:4:0-41:23) with lerobot SO-101; confirm joint ordering/units and streaming rate.
- Wire [ModelRunner](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/model_runner.py:4:0-37:50) to SmolVLA; verify “pick up the ball”/“get the treat” loops with safety checks.

# Status
- Backend skeleton: complete and pushed.
- MVP backend: pending hardware/model integration, safety calibration, and passing smoke tests.

### Planner Response

# Update
- Added calibration config example and loader; SafetyManager now reads joint limits/ROI if provided.
- Added env flags in backend: `USE_HARDWARE`, `MODEL_MODE` (`scripted` default, placeholder `smolvla`), `CALIBRATION_PATH`.
- ArmAdapter accepts `use_hardware` and keeps mock fallback; prepped hooks for lerobot SO-101 integration.
- ModelRunner supports mode switching; scripted remains default fallback.

# What remains to fully finish backend
- Replace ArmAdapter internals with actual lerobot SO-101 calls.
- Implement real SmolVLA load and [infer()](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/model_runner.py:15:4-37:50) producing joint targets at 10–20 Hz.
- Populate SafetyManager with SO-101 real joint limits and workspace checks.
- Add calibration file and point `CALIBRATION_PATH` to it.
- Run pytest smoke tests and fix issues if any.

# Recommended next steps (backend-only)
- Provide your lerobot environment details so I can wire the SO-101 adapter:
  - Import path/module for SO-101 driver.
  - Connect parameters (e.g., serial/USB port).
  - Expected joint ordering and units (radians vs degrees).
  - API methods to stream joint targets.

- Provide SmolVLA checkpoint path and minimal inference interface:
  - Input tensor shapes (image size, joint vector order).
  - Output target format (absolute joint angles per step or deltas).
  - Any example script I should mirror.

I can then implement those two integrations directly in [ArmAdapter](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/adapters/arm_adapter.py:4:0-64:23) and [ModelRunner](cci:2://file:///c:/Users/henri/Documents/hackathon/LePetPal/backend/model_runner.py:4:0-37:50) while preserving the contract.
