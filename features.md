# Short answer
Yes—with a few explicit conditions. For a hackathon, AI-first, and fast parallelization, this plan is solid if you keep the Lite contract, enforce scope, and preserve a scripted fallback.

# Why I’m confident
- **Clear integration point**: A frozen v1.0-lite contract with polling and single-active-command prevents cross-team thrash.
- **AI-first focus**: Tasks prioritize the command loop + inference wrapper, dataset capture, and camera calibration over tooling and infra.
- **Risk buffers**: Scripted fallback for “pick up the ball,” guarded throw macro, and “Go Home” interrupt cover the most likely failure modes.

# Conditions to keep it safe
- **[scope discipline]** Must/Should/Could are followed. Must = live video, presets, polling status, single-active-command, Go Home interrupt.
- **[fixed camera]** One fixed viewpoint; no movement post-calibration; persist ROI/bowl/treat zones.
- **[data floor]** Aim 30–50 demos per behavior. If you can’t reach that, lean on fallback behaviors.
- **[safety]** Throw only from verified `ready_to_throw`; joint limit checks; “Go Home” preempts within ~1s.

# Biggest risks and mitigations
- **Model reliability** → Use scripted fallback flag; reduce to 2 behaviors if needed.
- **Vision sensitivity** → High-contrast ball/treat, stable lighting, simple color threshold assists in overlays.
- **Integration surprises** → Contract frozen; frontend backs off on 409; no SSE/Auth until stable.

# Sanity checklist before you double down
- **/health** returns ok and frontend can reach it.
- **/video_feed** renders with overlays (synthetic first).
- **/command → /status** polling reaches `succeeded|failed|aborted`.
- “**Give Treat**” completes end-to-end (first with mocks, then real).
- “**Go Home**” interrupts any command within ~1s.

# Quick confirmations
- **[Q1]** Stick with polling (no SSE) for v1.0-lite?
- **[Q2]** Start without auth; add token only if trivial?
- **[Q3]** Approve scripted fallback toggle for “pick up the ball” if the model lags?

# Status
- Features, user stories, and demands drafted and aligned to v1.0-lite.
- Work plan and contract support fast parallel development.
- Awaiting your yes/no on Q1–Q3 before I place docs into files or refine further.
