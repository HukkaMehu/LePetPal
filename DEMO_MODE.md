# Demo Mode Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the demo mode for the Dog Monitor application. Demo mode allows you to explore the application with pre-loaded sample data and pre-recorded video without needing a live camera feed.

## Overview

Demo mode includes:
- **Sample Database Records**: Events, metrics, clips, snapshots, routines, and AI models
- **Mock Media Files**: Placeholder images and a looping demo video
- **Demo Video Streaming**: Pre-recorded video instead of live camera feed
- **Demo User Account**: Pre-configured user for testing

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- PostgreSQL database running (via Docker Compose)
- Backend dependencies installed (`pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`)
- Frontend dependencies installed (`npm install` in frontend directory)

### 2. Start Services

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps
```

### 3. Run Database Migrations

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### 4. Seed the Database

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/seed_database.py
```

**Output:**
```
ðŸŒ± Starting database seeding...

âœ“ Created demo user: demo@dogmonitor.com
âœ“ Created 350 sample events over 7 days
âœ“ Created sample metrics for 7 days
âœ“ Created 10 sample clips
âœ“ Created 15 sample snapshots
âœ“ Created 3 sample routines
âœ“ Created sample AI models

âœ… Database seeding completed successfully!

Demo user email: demo@dogmonitor.com
Demo user ID: [uuid]
```

### 5. Generate Mock Media

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/generate_mock_media.py
```

**Output:**
```
ðŸŽ¬ Generating mock media files...

Creating mock snapshots...
  âœ“ Created backend/mock_media/snapshots/snapshot_1.jpg
  âœ“ Created backend/mock_media/snapshots/snapshot_2.jpg
  ...

Creating mock clip previews...
  âœ“ Created backend/mock_media/clips/clip_1_preview.jpg

  âœ“ Created backend/mock_media/clips/sample_clip.mp4

âœ… Mock media generation completed!
   Snapshots: backend/mock_media/snapshots
   Clips: backend/mock_media/clips
```

### 6. Enable Demo Mode

**Option A: Via Settings UI**
1. Start the frontend: `npm run dev` (in frontend directory)
2. Navigate to Settings page: `http://localhost:3000/settings`
3. Scroll to "Video Settings" section
4. Check "Enable Demo Mode"
5. Click "Save Changes"

**Option B: Via Demo Page**
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/demo`
2. Click "Enable Demo Mode" button

**Option C: Manually**
```javascript
// In browser console
const settings = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('videoSettings') || '{}');
settings.demoMode = true;
localStorage.setItem('videoSettings', JSON.stringify(settings));
```

### 7. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 8. Access Demo Mode

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and you should see:
- Demo video playing in the video player
- "DEMO MODE" watermark on the video
- Sample events in the event feed
- Historical metrics in analytics charts

## Using Demo Mode

### Video Streaming

When demo mode is enabled, video endpoints use the demo video:

**MJPEG Stream:**
```
GET http://localhost:8000/video/mjpeg?demo=true
```

**WebRTC Offer:**
```
POST http://localhost:8000/video/webrtc/offer?demo=true
```

The frontend automatically adds the `demo=true` parameter when demo mode is enabled in settings.

## Resetting Demo Data

To reset and regenerate demo data:

```bash
# Option 1: Drop and recreate database
cd backend
alembic downgrade base
alembic upgrade head
python scripts/seed_database.py

# Option 2: Delete demo user data
# Connect to PostgreSQL and run:
DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'demo@dogmonitor.com';
# Then re-run seed script
python scripts/seed_database.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Error
```
Error: could not connect to server
```
**Solution**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running
```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

### Import Errors
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
```
**Solution**: Run from backend directory
```bash
cd backend
python scripts/seed_database.py
```

### Mock Media Generation Fails
```
ImportError: No module named 'cv2'
```
**Solution**: Install OpenCV
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### Demo Video Not Playing
**Symptoms**: Test pattern shows instead of demo video

**Solutions**:
1. Verify file exists:
   ```bash
   ls backend/mock_media/clips/sample_clip.mp4
   ```

2. Regenerate video:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python scripts/generate_mock_media.py
   ```

3. Check file permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 backend/mock_media/clips/sample_clip.mp4
   ```

### Demo Mode Not Activating
**Symptoms**: Live test pattern shows even with demo mode enabled

**Solutions**:
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check localStorage:
   ```javascript
   console.log(localStorage.getItem('videoSettings'));
   ```
3. Manually enable:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('videoSettings', JSON.stringify({demoMode: true}));
   ```

### No Events Showing
**Symptoms**: Event feed is empty

**Solutions**:
1. Verify seeding completed:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;
   ```
2. Check user ID matches:
   ```sql
   SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'demo@dogmonitor.com';
   ```
3. Re-run seed script

## API Endpoints for Demo Data

### Get Demo User Events
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/events?from=2024-10-18T00:00:00Z&to=2024-10-25T23:59:59Z"
```

### Get Demo Metrics
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/analytics/daily?from=2024-10-18&to=2024-10-25"
```

### Get Demo Clips
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/clips"
```

### Get Demo Snapshots
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/snapshots"
```

### Get Demo Routines
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/routines"
```

## Notes

- Demo data is randomly generated with realistic variations
- Timestamps are relative to current time for realistic experience
- The seed script is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Demo video loops continuously
- All S3 URIs are placeholder paths (actual files not uploaded)
- Mock media files are generated locally, not uploaded to S3/MinIO

## Next Steps

After exploring demo mode:
1. Disable demo mode in settings
2. Connect a real camera for live streaming
3. Configure AI service for real detections
4. Set up S3/MinIO for actual media storage
5. Create your own user account
6. Start real training sessions!
